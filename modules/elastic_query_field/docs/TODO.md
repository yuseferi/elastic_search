# TODO

- query validation
- cache settings on field instance for result query caching
    would be nice if this could have a time and a tags/contexts set of options available
    this should be set at display widget level, so that the same field can  be used in different places with different caching options
- output options, either the raw json, to be used in the front end directly or using the result to interact with the db and load the nodes
