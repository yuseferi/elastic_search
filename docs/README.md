# Elastic Search

Supported by [PwC's Experience Center Zurich](http://digital.pwc.ch/en/)

The elastic_search module for Drupal 8 largely deals with matters of configuration and mapping for your server and attempts to give you total control of the way in which documents are mapped.
This means that the module is largely configuration, this guide attempts to explain how this works and walk you through a setup of the elastic_search module.

Although we have tried to make the module as simple as possible to configure elastic search is complicated and it pays to spends some time with your configuration as the best search results come about through good mappings.
A good knowledge of Elastic Search will help with this and we strongly recommend having read the [Elastic Search Book](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/index.html)
and having the documentation about [field mapping options](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html) available when configuring your site.
